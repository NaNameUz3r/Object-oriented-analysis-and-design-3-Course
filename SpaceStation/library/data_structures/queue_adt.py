"""
BaseQueue abstract data type (base class) definition for
implementing a queue like data types.

CONSTANTS

    REMOVE_FRONT_NIL = 0              # remove_front() was not called
    REMOVE_FRONT_OK = 1               # last remove_front() call completed
    REMOVE_FRONT_ERR = 2              # last remove_front() call was not completed

    GET_VALUE_NIL = 0            # get_value() was not called
    GET_VALUE_OK = 1             # last get_value() call completed successfully
    GET_VALUE_ERR = 2            # storage is empty

CONSTRUCTOR

    __new__(cls) -> new queue instance
        POST-CONDITION:
            - The queue instance has been created.
    __init__(self):
        POST-CONDITION:
            - The queue command statuses are set to corresponding NIL constants.
            - The queue inner storage size is 0

COMMANDS

    add_tail(self, item: object) — Inserts adds the _item_ in the end of the queue.
        POST-CONDITION:
            - The _item_ is added to the end of the queue.

    remove_front(self) — Delete the "head" item from the queue.
        PRE-CONDITION:
            - The queue is not empty.
            - Item removed from head of queue.

    clear(self) — Delete all items from the queue.
        POST-CONDITION:
            - The queue has been cleared of items.

REQUESTS

    __len__(self) -> Count of enqueued items in queue

    get_first(self) — Returns the value of the first item in queue (item from head).
        PRE-CONDITION:
            - The queue is not empty.
        POST-CONDITION:
            - The first item value has been returned.

STATUS REQUESTS

    get_dequeue_status(self)    -> returns value of DEQUEUE_*
    get_get_value_status(self)  -> returns value of GET_VALUE_*
